# ReadMe-Generator
This generator uses NodeJs in order to generate a ReadMe for developers that want to create a ReadMe fast and clean. The user creates the README.md from the command line and this will reduce the amount of time it takes to create a proffesional README. Simple questions are asked that would be presented in a traditional but proffesional README and inquirer takes that information to generate a README.
